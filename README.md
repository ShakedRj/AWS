## Robo Advisor for Retirement Plans:

#### main tasks:

- Initial Robo Advisor Configuration: Defining an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment
  portfolio for retirement.

- Building and Testing the Robo Advisor: Making sure that the bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user, by building and testing it.

- Enhancing the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function: Creating an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation.
  This task includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.
  
  The user can choose from four risk levels: none, low, medium, high. According to his choice of risk level the Robo Advisor will output the matching answer.
